# Travis Configuration

Your project might have different build requirements - however, this project's `.travis.yml` configuration is supposed to represent a good starting point.

## Node JS Version

The minimum `Node` and `npm` versions that edX supports is `8.9.3` and `5.5.1`, respectively.

## Caching node_modules

While [the `Travis` blog](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2016-11-21-travis-ci-now-supports-yarn) recommends

```yaml
cache:
  directories:
    - node_modules
```

this causes issues when testing different versions of `Node` because [`node_modules` will store the compiled native modules](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42523517/5225575).

Caching the `~/.npm` directory avoids storing these native modules.

## Notifications

This project uses a service called [`TravisBuddy`](https://www.travisbuddy.com/), which provides Travis build context within a PR via webhooks (configured only to add feedback for build failures).

## Installing `greenkeeper-lockfile`

As explained in [the `Greenkeeper` documentation](https://greenkeeper.io/docs.html#greenkeeper-step-by-step), `Greenkeeper` is a service that keeps track of your project's dependencies, and will, for example, automatically open PRs with an updated `package.json` file when the latest version of a dependency is a major version ahead of the existing dependency version in your `package.json` file.

This automated updating is great, but `Greenkeeper` does not update your `package-lock.json` file, just your `package.json` file. This makes sense, as the only way to update the `package-lock.json` file would be to run `npm install` when building your project, using the latest `package.json`, and then committing the updated `package-lock.json` file.

This is essentially what you have to do manually when `Greenkeeper` opens a PR - `git checkout` the branch, `npm install` locally, `git commit` the `package-lock.json` changes, and then `git push` those changes to the `Greenkeeper` branch on `origin`. It's fun probably only the first time, and even then it gets old, fast.

What [`greenkeeper-lockfile`](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) does is that it automates the previous steps as part of the build process.

It will
  * Check that the branch is a `Greenkeeper` branch
  * Update the lockfile
  * Push a commit with the updated lockfile back to the Greenkeeper branch

This is why it's important to install `greenkeeper-lockfile` in the `before_install` step, and since it's used exclusively only in the Travis Build, why it's not part of the package's dependencies.

## Scripts

Most of the `script`s are self-explanatory - you probably want to fail a build if there are linting violations, or if any tests don't pass, or if it cannot compile your files.

However, there are a couple additional `script`s that might seem less self-explanatory.

### What the heck is `make validate-no-uncommitted-package-lock-changes`?

There are only two requirements for a good `make target` name

1. Definitely make it really verbose so people can't remember what it's called
2. Definitely don't not use a double-negative

What `make validate-no-uncommitted-package-lock-changes` does is `git diff`s for any `package-lock.json` file changes in your project. It's important to remember that all build `script`s are executed in Travis *after* the `install` step (aka post-`npm install`).

This is important because `npm` uses the pinned dependencies in your `package-lock.json` file to build the `node_modules` directory. However, the dependencies defined within the `package.json` file can be modified manually, for example, to become misaligned with the dependencies defined within the `package-lock.json`. So when `npm install` executes, the `package-lock.json` file will be updated to mirror the modified `package.json` changes.

However, when these changes surface within a Travis build, this indicates differing dependency expectations between the committed `package.json` file and the `package-lock.json` file, which is a good reason to fail a build.

### What is this `npm run is-es5` check?

This project outputs production files to the `dist` folder. The `npm script`, `npm run is-es5`, checks the JavaScript files in the `dist` folder to make sure that they are `ES5`-compliant.

This check is important because `ES5` JavaScript has [greater browser compatibility](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) than [`ES2015+`](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) - particularly for `IE11`.

### `deploy` step

How your project deploys will probably differ between the cookie cutter and your own application.

For demonstrational purposes, the cookie cutter deploys to GitHub pages using [`Travis`'s GitHub pages configuration](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/).

Your application might deploy to an `S3` bucket or to `npm`.
